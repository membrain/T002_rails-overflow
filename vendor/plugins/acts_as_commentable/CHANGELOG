* Changes in version 72c1a4b3dfffaebe2dc25fcea09f9481305fc7e3
  - bumped version to 2.0.2
  - moved the setting of the default order for comments from inside the plugin
    to the generated Comment model. This will help with the current bug in Rails
    that prevents people from overriding this. Now they can just delete from the model,
    set it differently, etc. 
* revision 8: Changed has_many :dependent => true to :dependent => :destroy for Rails 1.2.2
                 + Thanks Josh Martin
              Added an order clause in the has_many relationship.
              Made comment column type to text from string in migration example in README
                 + Thanks Patrick Crowley
              Added this CHANGELOG file.
