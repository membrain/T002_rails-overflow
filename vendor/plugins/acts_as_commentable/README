 end
 
 * Add a comment to a model instance
 
 commentable = Model.create
 commentable.comments.create(:title => "First comment.", :comment => "This is the first comment.")

 * Fetch comments for a commentable model:
 
 commentable = Model.find(1)
 comments = commentable.comments.recent.limit(10).all
